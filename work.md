I'm a freelance programmer based in Haslemere, Surrey, UK.

I have over a decade of experience and have worked with a lot of different technologies
and languages although I prefer tools which are both highly productive and open (e.g. Python).
I'm excited by building new systems and websites, and enjoy working with intelligent and creative
people who value and uphold high standards.

I'm usually open to new and interesting opportunities so do please get in touch if you have a
project I may be able to help with.

Please see [my full CV](/cv/) for details of past work.

## Talks
* __Managing Mocks__ - a look at mocking in Python
	* PyCon UK, September 2015 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haXUaGTp8Bc), [slides](http://slides.com/helenst/managingmocks2015))
	* Europython, July 2016 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ahnw72diels), [slides](http://slides.com/helenst/managingmocks2016))
* __Planning a Python Event__ - PyCon Namibia, January 2016 - about planning Django Girls workshops ([slides](http://slides.com/helenst/planningpython2016)) 

## Other things
* [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) coach at multiple workshops - this involves mentoring small groups of beginner programmers.
* Organising Django Girls workshops at [PyCon UK](https://djangogirls.org/pyconuk/) and [PyCon Namibia](https://djangogirls.org/windhoek/) - these are beginner level workshops giving around 30 women the opportunity to build their first web application using Python / Django with the guidance of an experienced coach.
* If you want to see how I solve small coding puzzles, have a look at [my exercism.io profile](http://exercism.io/profiles/helenst/cf852db9adc04fdcadb486e03223bebc) - I also hang out on there a lot helping others improve their Python skills.

## Personal projects
* [Map Thing](http://mapthing.helen.st/) is a route planner which supports routing through Google or Open Street Map. I created it because I wanted to plan routes along bridleways and footpaths, something which most online mappers don't support. I use it frequently when planning runs and bike rides.
* [Train Times](https://github.com/helenst/train-times-display) - a Raspberry Pi / LCD display project written in Python. It lives in my hallway and keeps me informed of when the next trains are departing. Incredibly useful and helps me get out of the house on time!
