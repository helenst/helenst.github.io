I'm a freelance programmer based in Haslemere, Surrey, UK. 

Sometimes I travel. You can read about my adventures on [Bike Hippies](http://bikehippies.com/). Despite the name, it doesn't always involve bicycles.

I [used to take a lot of photos](https://www.flickr.com/orangebrompton).

[I make a lot of art](https://www.instagram.com/sherbertflavour/).

I also enjoy cycling, kayaking, trail running and orienteering.
