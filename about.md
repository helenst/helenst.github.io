I'm a freelance programmer based in Haslemere, Surrey, UK. 

I used to take a lot of [photos](https://www.flickr.com/orangebrompton).

These days I'm more into [painting and drawing](https://www.instagram.com/sherbertflavour/).

Sometimes I [travel](http://bikehippies.com/).

I also enjoy cycling, kayaking, trail running and orienteering.
