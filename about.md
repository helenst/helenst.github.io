I'm a freelance programmer based in Haslemere, Surrey, UK. Between projects, my partner and enjoy travelling the world. We keep a travel blog called Bike Hippies which, despite the name, doesn't always involve bicycles.

I'm a keen photographer too - mostly a mix of landscape, travel, wildlife, long exposure and the occasional weird experiment. I also enjoy cycling, trail running and orienteering.
