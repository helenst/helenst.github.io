I'm a freelance programmer based in Haslemere, Surrey, UK. Between projects, I enjoy travelling the world with my husband. We keep a travel blog called [Bike Hippies](http://bikehippies.com/) which, despite the name, doesn't always involve bicycles.

I'm a [keen photographer](https://www.flickr.com/orangebrompton) too - mostly a mix of landscape, travel, wildlife, long exposure and the occasional weird experiment. I also enjoy cycling, trail running and orienteering.
