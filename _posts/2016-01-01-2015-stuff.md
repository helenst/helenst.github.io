The year started out with wedding planning, some of it was fun but I'm glad it only went on for a couple of months!

In January we made each others rings at a workshop:

Then in March we gave them to each other:

Then we went to Japan!

We saw cherry blossoms, rode bullet trains and ate amazing sushi but to pick three of our best highlights:

MAGLEVS! We went to the [Yamanashi test track](http://linear-museum.pref.yamanashi.jp/english/index.html) to watch 500km/h maglev trains being tested.

We went to Okunoshima island and got covered in bunnies!

We had a lot of amazing food in Japan but for us Kobe beef was one of the real highlights

In June I went to DjangoCon EU and discovered that I like Cardiff. I brought my Brompton and went for some lovely rides.

At the conference there I also had my first [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org) involvement there, coaching two ladies through building their first website. Then on the train home from Cardiff I got an email asking if I'd like to help organise another Django Girls workshop at PyCon UK. I've been going to PyCon UK for a few years and was excited about Django Girls so it was a hard thing to say no to! So three months later, [this happened](http://blog.djangogirls.org/post/131219843343/django-girls-at-pycon-uk-coventry) and I was very proud to be a part of it!

One of the things I'm most proud of this year is becoming less afraid of presenting and public speaking. I dipped my toes in the water by giving a speech at my wedding, and it wasn't too scary. I also took on a job this year which involved making quite a few presentations to various boards and groups... I won't say I'm great at it, but hopefully it's something I can improve on! After much encouragement from various people I also gave my first conference talk at PyCon UK - this was terrifying but also incredibly fun and I plan to do more!
