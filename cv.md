## Profile

I am a freelance programmer with over a decade of experience developing software and websites using a wide range of languages and technologies.

Recent projects include a technical refresh of the Pointbank incentives platform and building key elements of the latest BBC Weather website.

I choose to work with productive high level languages such as Python, but also have a strong background in systems development and optimisation. I am confident with the Linux command line and am experienced with front end web technologies and best practice.

I enjoy working with creative and intelligent people, building on open software and APIs to create solid and elegant systems.
