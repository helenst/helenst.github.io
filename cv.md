## Profile

Freelance programmer with over a decade of experience developing high quality software using a wide range of technologies.

Key projects include research software management tools for UCL, a technical refresh of the Pointbank incentives platform and building the BBC Weather website.

I choose to work with productive high level languages such as Python, but also have a strong background in systems development and optimisation. I am confident with the Linux command line and am experienced with web development.

I enjoy working with creative and intelligent people, building on open software and APIs to create solid and elegant systems.
