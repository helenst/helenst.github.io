## Profile

Freelance programmer with over two decades of experience developing high quality software using a wide range of technologies.

Key projects include work on the Archivematica digital preservation platform, research software tools for UCL, a technical refresh of the Pointbank incentives platform and building the BBC Weather website.

I choose to work with productive high level languages such as Python, but also have a strong background in systems development and optimisation. I am confident with the Linux command line and am experienced with web development (mainly back end, but I'm happy to work with relatively simple front ends too)

I enjoy working with creative and intelligent people, building on open software and APIs to create solid and elegant systems.

* Created AWS lambda to initiate transfers from S3
* Improved S3 browse and transfer functionality
* Collaborated with Artefactual to upgrade components to Python 3
* Contributed numerous bugfixes to Archivematica
* AWS deployments using Terraform, ECS, Docker
* Worked on Archivematica components of JISC RDSS (now <https://www.jisc.ac.uk/preservation>)
* Added Django authentication plugins for Shibboleth, LDAP and OIDC / Azure

### [Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) - Data Safe Haven (2018)

### [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/) - Cardiac Electrophysiology Web Lab (2017-20)

Web Lab is a platform to support the use and development of cardiac electrophysiology models, developed as a collaboration between Oxford, UCL and Nottingham universities. I initially carried out a feature-complete Django rewrite of a Java-based web interface, creating a git-based backend for model and protocol iteration, and later returned to add new functionality to support work around fitting models to datasets.

Worked fully remotely on Django-based legal practice management software, fixing bugs and adding new features including auditing and logging tools.


### [University College London](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/) - Research Software Dashboard (2015-17)

Worked alongside [Research IT Services](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/services/research-it) building [RSD Dashboard](https://dashboard.rc.ucl.ac.uk), a tool for sharing and discovering the university's research software. This was full stack Django development of a brand new product, seen through from initial development to launch. I was the sole developer, collaborating closely with research software developers and providing fortnightly demos. I originally worked on Dashboard for 9 months, returning a year later to add further improvements.


### [Pointbank](http://pointbank.co.uk/) (2013-14)

Technical refresh of Pointbank, a corporate incentives platform built in Django. My key contributions included rebuilding the front end with Sass for improved extensibility and easy rebranding, and developing an activity feed based on the [Activity Streams](http://activitystrea.ms/) standard. I was the sole developer on this platform, working remotely and meeting the client for fortnightly demos.


### BBC Weather (2011-12)

Development of the BBC Weather website, working on highly visible components including the daily forecast tabs and dynamic weather maps. Building the front end and middle layers, I worked closely with the service layer team to define RESTful interfaces, adding optimisations for quick page load and minimal impact on back end services. After an initial three month contract I returned twice to add further improvements.
