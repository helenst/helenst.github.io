## Profile

Freelance programmer with over two decades of experience developing high quality software using a wide range of technologies.

Key projects include work on the Archivematica digital preservation platform, research software tools for UCL, a technical refresh of the Pointbank incentives platform and building the BBC Weather website.

I choose to work with productive high level languages such as Python, but also have a strong background in systems development and optimisation. I am confident with the Linux command line and am experienced with web development (mainly back end, but I'm happy to work with relatively simple front ends too)

I enjoy working with creative and intelligent people, building on open software and APIs to create solid and elegant systems.
